# DudeBot
My custom Java Bot for Twitch IRC implementing PircBot 1.5 Library
* **Done:**
connects to server
commands:
    -!game
    -!stats
writes and reads to file
    -keeps list of people who have joined channel
    -keeps track of minutes spent in channel
    -keeps track of points

* **Working On:**
GUI
    -setting channel
    -setting OAuth
    -setting currency name
* **TODO:**
Keep track of settings between sessions(config)
mini-games
pay-able sounds
intro (text+sound)
dynamic addition/subtraction of purchasable "things"
    i.e. server access (will most likely keep record in a file and let streamer handle)
